# Blog App Backend

## Overview

Welcome to the backend repository of the Blog App developed using Spring Boot! This project focuses on creating robust and efficient APIs for a Blog App. The comprehensive tech stack includes Spring Boot 3+, Spring Security 6+, Spring Data JPA, JWT authentication, MySQL database, Springdoc OpenAPI, Swagger, and more.

## What I've Learned and Implemented:

1. **REST Basics:** Understanding the fundamentals of REST architecture, including resources, sub-resources, URIs, HTTP methods, and HTTP status codes.
   
2. **CRUD Operations:** Designing and implementing CRUD operations for comprehensive API functionality.
   
3. **Pagination and Sorting:** Implementing techniques for efficient data retrieval through pagination and sorting in REST APIs.

4. **User Authentication:** Implementing robust user authentication with login/signin and signup functionalities.

5. **Additional Tools:** Utilizing Lombok and DTOs for streamlined and efficient code development.

6. **Exception Handling and Validation:** Implementing effective methods for handling exceptions and validating REST API requests.

7. **Spring Security:** Exploring in-memory and database authentication and authorization for securing REST APIs with role-based security.

8. **Query Methods:** Mastering the art of writing query methods using Spring Data JPA for efficient data retrieval.

9. **JPA Mappings:** Exploring one-to-many and many-to-many JPA mappings for complex data relationships.

10. **Postman Testing:** Learning how to thoroughly test REST APIs using the Postman REST Client.

11. **JWT Implementation:** Understanding the intricacies of JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and configuring them within Spring Security for securing APIs.

12. **API Versioning:** Exploring various versioning strategies for evolving REST APIs over time.

13. **AWS Deployment:** Gaining practical insights into deploying the Spring Boot Blog App on the AWS Cloud using Elastic Beanstalk.
